# Travel App Project

## Overview
Travel App allows the user to get pertinent weather data and an image of their upcoming travel destination.

### Some Small Deets
This project is highly modularized. Is that even a word? Regardless, it was for debugging purposes and will server you well if you're following the console error breadcrumb trail to fix any tweaks you might have made.

Also, I left some commented-out debug tests in place at crucial chokepoints in the code for your troubleshooting.

## Instructions
1. Clone this project from the master branch of the [project](https://github.com/MattyLoCo/Travel-App-Project)  
2. Navigate to the root folder of your cloned project on your local disk, download, and install **[Node.js]**(https://nodejs.org/en/#download "Required for this project to work")
3. In the root folder of the project, open your CLI, and install [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/ "Also super necessary") in your command interface `npm install`
4. Install and update all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file
5. Spin up your express server with the assigned script `npm run start`
6. Then build out the distribution folder with `npm run prod`
7. Finally, enter `npm run dev`, which should take you to your default browser to interact with Travel App
